      h3 Why I did this?
      p Out there already exist travisneilson DevTipsStarterKit, shakyShane jekyll-gulp-sass-browser-sync, mriverodorta DevTips-Starter-Kit-Gulp version and lots of others.
      p While travisneilson version is a very basic version, that just order the place of work, shakyShane uses Gulp and include Jekyll in the mix, but mriverodorta is very pollished and have losts of customizations included in form of configuration items. So why another of this things?
      p The thing is I am not comfortable using stuff I do not understand so my quest to understandig began.
      p Now I am in a point where I could make everythig work the way I like, understandig what I am actualy doing. So I am doing it.
      p It would be huge if some one even look at what I have done and it would be a mayor achivment if some one quotes me in thei own version.
